# FinalProject
This was my final project for the AP Computer Science A class. It is a multi-screen Blackjack game, where one player plays against a computer emulating the house. There is memory capacity that will keep track of the money a player has, beginning with the app being downloaded to their device. Also, there are screens for credit, intro, acquiring money, playing and winning. It was created with AndroidStudio.
